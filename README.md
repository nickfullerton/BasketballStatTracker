# BasketballStatTracker

Clean, easy-to-use design that allows you to track your teams stats using Dear Py GUI.  
It includes 2-pointers, 3-pointers, free throws, assists, and rebounds.


# Basic GUI

Super clean GUI, easy-to-use design, might change it in the future

# Future

I will pick this up sometime in the future to add small features.  

1. Save function to save completed games or in progress game, if completed game, then being able to save the players stats   
2. Make it a desktop application   
3. Change up the GUI, add new colors, fonts, etc.  
4. A main menu, being able to start/continue a game, create a team instead of creating it inside the game, being able to view a already created team stats
